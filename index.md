# Emma Rindlisbacher

Hi there. I'm a reporter and I write about all sorts of topics: student debt, criminal justice, and financial policy just to name a few. I like stories that involve interesting documents. I also like stories that involve complicated systems that are producing suboptimal outcomes.

## Reporting

(Not a complete list.)

### Finance

* [Late Payments and Confusion: One Startup’s Struggle to Make Rent Easier](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/06/flex-rent-housing-portals/)   
   As Flex worked to overcome technological obstacles, it turned to a decidedly low-tech solution—an army of temp workers who, until recently, made many of the rent payments by manually logging into landlords’ payment portals on behalf of Flex customers. That process had a potential flaw: As Flex’s spokesperson acknowledged, it could have been possible for the temps to retain user data on their personal computers. She noted, however, that there is no evidence this ever occurred or was even attempted. 

* [She Accused Her Ex-Husband of Abuse. She’s Still Stuck With His Student Loans.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/04/spousal-consolidation-student-loans/)   
  Spousal consolidation loans came with a catch: There is no mechanism to separate the two borrowers’ loans, even after a marriage falls apart.
  
* [Biden Promised Student Debt Relief for Public Service Workers. The Reality Has Been Painful.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/01/biden-promised-student-debt-relief-for-public-service-workers-the-reality-has-been-painful/)  
  “Even the best targeting is going to leave out borrowers who we need to be able to capture.”

* [Do we know what jobs are in high demand?](https://workshift.opencampusmedia.org/do-we-know-what-jobs-are-in-high-demand/)   
  Measuring which fields are in demand is harder than it sounds. Many of the available data sources, experts say, have significant flaws. And that causes problems for education providers who are trying to understand market demand and map their programs to it.
 
* [Revature Coding Program Promises Jobs—but Costs $36,500 to Quit](https://onezero.medium.com/recent-grads-are-being-lured-into-indentured-servitude-by-a-coding-bootcamp-8a3b2b8e87e8)   
  Recent grads are being lured into ‘indentured servitude’ by a training program that costs $36,500 to quit

### Criminal Justice

* [“An Extreme Amount of Pain”: How a Notorious Jail Failed a Disabled Transgender Inmate](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2023/01/mdc-brooklyn-jail-health-care/)   
  At one point, one of the numerous judges who has rotated through Sternquist’s case threatened to sanction the Department of Justice over the jail’s failure to obey a court order regarding her housing. In at least two other instances, judges issued orders regarding her medical care, but the jail failed to comply before the court-imposed deadlines had passed, according to court transcripts and documents.

### Politics

* [This Republican Wants to Extend a Real Estate Tax Break. He Could Be a Big Beneficiary.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/tracey-mann-congress-opportunity-zones-austin/)  
  Rep. Tracey Mann invested heavily in opportunity zones.

* [Dems Demanding SALT Tax Cuts Stand to Benefit](https://www.levernews.com/democrats-gunning-to-end-salt-cap-stand-to-benefit/)   
  Lawmakers leading the charge to reinstate state and local tax breaks could score thousands in annual deductions.
 

## Research and Miscellaneous

I occasionally will help various types of organizations conduct research. 

* [Flying Under the Regulation Radar: University Partnerships with Coding Bootcamps](https://tcf.org/content/report/flying-regulation-radar-university-partnerships-coding-bootcamps/)   
  Bootcamps—for-profit, unaccredited, short-term educational programs—have continued to find new university partners during the pandemic. These partnerships have been especially lucrative for coding bootcamps—a popular variant that teaches computer programming—who typically collect 80 percent of the revenue generated from the program and who use the partnerships to gain exemptions from state regulations. But the lack of oversight of these partnerships is cause for concern, especially given past abuses in the industry.
