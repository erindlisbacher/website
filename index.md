# Emma Rindlisbacher

Hi, I'm a reporter. I currently work at [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/author/emma-rindlisbacher/). Before that I was a freelance journalist. 

I write about all sorts of topics: student debt, criminal justice, and financial policy just to name a few. I like stories that involve interesting documents. I also like stories that involve complicated systems that are producing suboptimal outcomes.

## Tell Me What to Write About

Please reach out if there is a story that you feel needs more attention.
