# Emma Rindlisbacher's Personal Website

This is a really basic personal website. This GitHub repository stores the Jekyll source code that powers the website. I then use Netlify to compile and host the actual website at <https://lunarsystematics.com>. I like doing this instead of using a point and click website generator because I have fun designing my own website.
